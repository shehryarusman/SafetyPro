            <h1> The Urgency of Proper Waste Management</h1>
            <p>
            Waste management and recycling have become increasingly important in recent years 
            due to a growing waste crisis. According to the World Bank, global waste generation 
            is expected to reach 3.4 billion tonnes by 2050, up from 2.01 billion tonnes in 2016. 
            In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that Americans generated 292.4
            million tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) in 2018, with only about 32% recycled or 
            composted, and the rest sent to landfills or incinerated. Proper waste management can help 
            reduce greenhouse gas emissions, conserve natural resources, and protect human health 
            and the environment.
