                    I was responsible for both backend and frontend development for our project. 
                    This involved creating the website from scratch and implementing text sentiment analysis in our application. 
                    Additionally, I worked on optimizing multithreading to ensure smooth performance for our users.

                    I focused on the backend of our application, specifically working on the image-to-text mapping to ensure that our app 
                    effectively blocks harmful content on the internet. Additionally, I played a key role in fixing the multithreading for 
                    improved performance and helped integrate the AI with the frontend text blocking.

                    I was responsible for the majority of the AI development for our application. This included setting up the API for word classification,
                    which allows our app to effectively block harmful words. Additionally, I worked on AI text detection to ensure accurate blocking of harmful text.
